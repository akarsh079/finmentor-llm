# finmentor-llm

FinMentor is a finance education engine for teens and young adults.  
It uses a curated dataset of financial literacy topics and questions to provide clear, beginner-friendly explanations of budgeting, credit, banking, taxes, and investing basics.

This repository contains:
- A structured JSON knowledge base of financial categories and questions
- Early backend structure for routing and explanation generation
- Documentation outlining the system architecture and MVP design
- Future plans for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), dynamic data, and model fine-tuning

**Status:**  
This project is in the architecture + foundation-building phase.  
No RAG, no embeddings, no ML training, and no dynamic APIs are implemented yet.
