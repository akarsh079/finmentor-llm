title: Compound Interest
category: credit
difficulty: beginner

summary:
  - Compound interest is interest that is calculated on both an original amount and on interest that has already been added over time. As interest accumulates, it becomes part of the amount used in future interest calculations.

core_mechanics:
  - Interest is calculated on the principal amount as well as on previously accumulated interest
  - As interest is added to a balance, future interest calculations are based on a larger amount
  - The frequency at which interest is calculated and added (such as annually or monthly) affects how quickly the balance changes
  - Compound interest differs from simple interest, which is calculated only on the original principal
  - Compounding can apply to both money saved or invested and to money owed on certain types of debt

examples:
  - scenario: A balance earns interest each year, and the interest is added to the balance
    explanation: In later periods, interest is calculated on a larger amount because earlier interest has been included in the balance

misconceptions:
  - Compound interest is the same as simple interest
  - Compound interest only applies to savings or investments and not to debt

non_goals:
  - Explaining strategies or methods to increase returns or reduce interest costs
  - Recommending specific financial products, accounts, or personal financial actions
