title: Annual Percentage Rate (APR)
category: credit
difficulty: intermediate

summary:
  - The annual percentage rate (APR) is a standardized measure of the cost of borrowing money over a year, expressed as a percentage. It reflects the loan’s interest rate plus certain additional costs required to obtain the loan.

core_mechanics:
  - APR is expressed as an annual rate intended to represent the overall cost of borrowing over a year
  - APR typically includes the stated interest rate along with certain fees or charges associated with the loan
  - Because APR incorporates more than just the interest rate, two loans with the same interest rate can have different APRs
  - APR is designed to support comparison across credit offers with different fee structures
  - The specific costs included in APR are defined by disclosure rules and can vary by loan type

examples:
  - scenario: Two loans advertise the same interest rate but charge different upfront fees
    explanation: Even though the interest rates match, the APRs differ because APR includes certain fees in addition to the interest rate

misconceptions:
  - APR and interest rate are interchangeable terms
  - A lower interest rate always results in a lower APR
