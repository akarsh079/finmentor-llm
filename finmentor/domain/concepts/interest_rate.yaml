difficulty: beginner

summary:
  - An interest rate is the price paid for borrowing money or the return earned for lending money, expressed as a percentage over a period of time. It represents how the value of money changes between the present and the future.

core_mechanics:
  - An interest rate is expressed as a percentage applied to a principal amount over a specified time period, often stated on an annual basis
  - When money is borrowed, the interest rate determines how much additional money is owed beyond the original amount
  - When money is lent or deposited, the interest rate determines how much additional money is earned over time
  - Interest rates may be fixed, meaning they remain constant, or variable, meaning they can change over time
  - An interest rate reflects only the stated rate itself and does not capture all costs associated with borrowing, which are represented separately by APR

examples:
  - scenario: A loan specifies an interest rate of 5 percent for one year
    explanation: At the end of the year, the amount owed is greater than the original loan because interest is calculated as a percentage of the original amount over the year

misconceptions:
  - An interest rate and an annual percentage rate (APR) are the same thing
  - An interest rate alone represents the total cost of borrowing
